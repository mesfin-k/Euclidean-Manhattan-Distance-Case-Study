# 📘 Euclidean and Manhattan Distance Case Study

This repository contains a visual and analytical comparison between **Euclidean** and **Manhattan** distance metrics, using a sample dataset of 2D points.

---

## 📊 Objective

To demonstrate and compare how the **Euclidean** and **Manhattan** distance metrics behave when calculating distance from a reference point in the 2D plane.

- **Euclidean Distance** (L2 norm): Straight-line ("as the crow flies") distance.
- **Manhattan Distance** (L1 norm): Grid-based or "taxicab" distance.

---

## 📌 Highlights

- Distance calculations from reference points like (4,4) and (5,5)
- Heatmap-style scatter plots based on distances
- Histograms to compare the distribution of distances
